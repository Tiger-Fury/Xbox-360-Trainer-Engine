This is my source code for my Xbox 360 trainer engine which i found in my back up storage. I'm no longer active in the development scene for the xbox 360 and i retired roughly in 2018 so i can't help with any queries. 
I'm adding this publically to help anyone who might still be active or wanting to develop on the Xbox 360

Requirements I can remember:

Jtag/RGH console to run code (might work in Xenia)

Visual Studio (2012 i believe)


Don't know this person but this video should help setting up XDK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIByRdNXgYM

delete the " from the trainers folder name

Please search my repo's if you are interested in a multi game trainer engine
